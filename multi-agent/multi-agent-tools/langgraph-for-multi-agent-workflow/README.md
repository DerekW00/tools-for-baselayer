# LangGraph for Multi-agent Workflow

LangGraph is a powerful framework designed to orchestrate complex workflows involving multiple agents. It allows you to model interactions between agents as a graph, where nodes represent agents or tools, and edges define the flow of information between them. This approach provides a structured and intuitive way to build sophisticated multi-agent systems, enabling you to tackle tasks that are beyond the capabilities of single agents.
