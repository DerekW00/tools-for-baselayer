# Multi-agent

## Introduction to Multi-Agent Systems

### What is a Multi-Agent System?

A **multi-agent system (MAS)** consists of multiple agents interacting within a shared environment to achieve individual or collective goals. These interactions can be cooperative, competitive, or both.

### Why Multi-Agent Systems?

* **Scalability:** Break down large problems into local agent tasks.
* **Robustness:** Avoid single points of failure.
* **Flexibility:** Agents adapt to local changes independently.
* **Emergent Behavior:** Complex global behavior can arise from simple local rules.

### Core Concepts

* **Agents:** Entities with autonomy, reactivity, pro-activeness, and social ability.
* **Environment:** Shared context where agents perceive and act.
* **Goals:** Can be individual vs. collective, compatible vs. conflicting, static vs. dynamic.
* **Interactions:** Mechanisms of communication, coordination, cooperation, competition, and negotiation.

### Strategic Foundations

* **Stochastic/Markov Games:** Multi-agent extension of MDPs; joint action sets, agent-specific rewards.
* **Nash Equilibrium:** A state where no agent can improve its outcome by unilaterally changing its strategy.
* **Team Settings:** Agents share rewards; centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) is common.

### Examples

* **Basic:** Two robots cooperating to move a heavy object.
* **Advanced:** Multiple trading agents competing and collaborating in stock markets.
* **Hypothetical:** A swarm of search-and-rescue robots dividing exploration tasks while aiming for a collective rescue mission.
