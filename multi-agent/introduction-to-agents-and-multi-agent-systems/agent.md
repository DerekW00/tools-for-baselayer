# Agent

## What is an Agent?

### Definition

An **agent** is an entity that has goals or preferences and performs a sequence of actions in order to maximize its expected outcome relative to those goals. At its core, an agent must decide **what to do** and **when to do it**, given its understanding of the environment.

Agents typically:

* Use **sensors** to perceive and gather information from the environment.
* Use **actuators** to take actions that influence the environment.

### Core Characteristics

* **Autonomy** – Operates without direct human intervention or constant external control.
* **Social Ability** – Can communicate and interact with other agents, coordinating actions to achieve shared or complementary goals.
* **Reactivity** – Perceives the environment and responds promptly to changes.
* **Pro-activeness** – Takes initiative to pursue goals, even in the absence of external stimuli.

### The Agent Lifecycle

1. Perceive the environment through sensors.
2. Update internal state or belief.
3. Decide on an action based on policy or planning.
4. Act upon the environment via actuators.
5. Receive feedback in the form of rewards or signals.
6. Learn and adapt over time.

### Examples

* **Basic:** A thermostat senses the temperature and adjusts heating or cooling to maintain the desired setpoint.
* **Advanced:** A self-driving car perceives its environment using cameras, radar, and lidar, then makes decisions about navigation and obstacle avoidance, controlling actuators such as steering and braking.
* **Hypothetical:** A swarm of nano-robots in the human body detects cancer cells and delivers targeted drugs to eliminate tumors.
