# Summary

## Summary and Next Steps

### Key Takeaways

* **Agents:** Autonomous entities that perceive, decide, and act to optimize outcomes.
* **Key Ideas:** Tasks, states, actions, policies, rewards, and the role of planning/learning.
* **Environments:** Fully vs. partially observable, deterministic vs. stochastic, static vs. dynamic, and more.
* **Multi-Agent Systems:** Comprised of multiple agents with individual or shared goals, interacting via communication, cooperation, or competition.
* **Architectures:** Centralized, decentralized, and hybrid structures each with unique trade-offs.
* **Practical Examples:** Smart homes, traffic systems, collaborative editing, and warehouses illustrate MAS design.

### Checklist for Designing Agents/MAS

* [ ] Define PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors).
* [ ] Identify the environment type.
* [ ] Choose an appropriate architecture.
* [ ] Establish performance metrics.
* [ ] Plan for safety and robustness.

### Next Steps

Proceed to the next chapter: **Setting Up Your Development Environment for LangGraph**. There, youâ€™ll learn how to install tools, create a minimal agent system, and begin building real MAS applications.
